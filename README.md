# Windicator

Windicator is the wind-pointing time lapse camera that is your window into the
atmosphere. Be sure to checkout all of the resources in this repository to
build your own.

## The Problem:
I want to create a tool to allow students or interested meteorology enthusiasts
to see the atmosphere flow and understand what is really happening then a front
or storm passes by. The atmosphere flows like a fluid with instabilities,
density currents, and many other phenomena that are fascinating but difficult to
follow due to their relatively slow movement. Static cameras are great, but
don't always follow the most interesting weather. 360 cameras are expensive,
produce a lot of data, and require the user to search for the most interesting
views.

## What the project does:
This project takes time-lapse photos of the atmosphere and combines them with
meteorological data on a webpage that can be easily explored. The camera is
continuously pointed in the direction the wind is blowing, so nature is steering
the lens to point at the most interesting phenomena in the area. The photos and
data can be explored at all levels from quick view to in-depth data analysis and
discussion.

## How itâ€™s going to change the world:
Understanding the Earth is a monumental task and something that is not ingrained
in many people. With increasing urbanization and modernization, the intuition
and connection to natural processes gained through experience is all but gone.
This project helps speed up nature so we can experience how dynamic our
atmosphere is. In addition, it is designed to be inexpensive so that it is
accessible to schools, students, and hobbyists. By using 3D printing, open
source hardware and software, and modern design tools, the project can easily
tie into many portions of the STEM curriculum. Students can build a real and
useful scientific instrument and learn from the process and data. The time-lapse
videos can also be shared as a community resource.
